# wordpress-vue-restapi-theme

This is a simple wordpress theme developed by Vue.js and WP REST API.

This theme is based on this [VueWordPress Theme Starter](https://github.com/EvanAgee/vuejs-wordpress-theme-starter) created by [EvanAgee](https://github.com/EvanAgee/vuejs-wordpress-theme-starter/commits?author=EvanAgee)

and this isn't generalized for public use, just uploaded as one of my works.

So, if you wanna use or customize this theme. Please fix it up along with your project.

Also [here](https://aoyamaorchestra.com/), you can see how this theme looks like, and works.
